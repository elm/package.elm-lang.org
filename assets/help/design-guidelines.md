# Design Guidelines

These guidelines are meant to promote consistency and quality across all Elm packages. It is a collection of best practices that will help you write better APIs and your users write better code. Here is the overview, but it is important to read through and see why these recommendations matter.

  * [Design for a concrete use case](#design-for-a-concrete-use-case)
  * [Avoid gratuitous abstraction](#avoid-gratuitous-abstraction)
  * [Write helpful documentation with examples](#write-helpful-documentation-with-examples)
  * [The data structure is always the last argument](#the-data-structure-is-always-the-last-argument)
  * [Keep tags and record constructors secret](#keep-tags-and-record-constructors-secret)
  * [Naming](#naming)
    - [Use human readable names](#use-human-readable-names)
    - [Module names should not reappear in function names](#module-names-should-not-reappear-in-function-names)


## Design for a concrete use case

Before you start writing a library, think about what your goal is.

* What is the concrete problem you want to solve?
* What would it mean for your API to be a success?
* Who has this problem? What do they want from an API?
* What specific things are needed to solve that problem?
* Have other people worked on this problem? What lessons can be learned from them? Are there specific weaknesses you want to avoid?

Actually think about these things. Write ideas on paper. Ask for advice from someone you trust. It will make your library better. If you are doing this right, you will have example code and a tentative API before you start implementing anything.


## Avoid gratuitous abstraction

Some functional programmers like to make their API as general as possible. This will reliably make your API harder to understand. Is that worth it? What concrete benefits are users gaining? Does that align with the concrete use case you have in mind for your library?

Abstraction is a tool, not a design goal. Unless abstraction is making someoneâ€™s life easier, it is not a good idea. If you cannot *demonstrate* why your abstraction is helpful, there is a problem with your API.


## Write helpful documentation with examples

[This document](/help/documentation-format) describes how documentation works in Elm, and you can preview your docs [here](/help/docs-preview).

Providing examples of common uses is extremely helpful. Do it! The standard libraries all make a point to have examples that show how one *should* be using those functions.

Also, make the documentation for the library itself helpful. Perhaps have an example that shows how to use many functions together, showcasing the API.

Finally, think hard about the order that the functions appear in and what kind of title each section gets. People will read documentation linearly when learning a library, so give them some structure!


## The data structure is always the last argument

Function composition works better when the data structure is the last argument:

```elm
getCombinedHeight people =
    people
      |> map .height
      |> foldl (+) 0
```

Folding also works better when the data structure is the last argument of the accumulator function. All `foldl` and `foldr` functions work this way:

```elm
-- Good API
remove : String -> Dict String a -> Dict String a

filteredPeople =
    foldr remove people ["Steve","Tom","Sally"]


-- Bad API
without : Dict String a -> String -> Dict String a

filteredPeople =
    foldr (flip without) people ["Steve","Tom","Sally"]
```

The order of arguments in fold is specifically intended to make this very straight-forward: *the data structure is always the last argument*.


## Keep tags and record constructors secret

It's convenient to be able to write `Point x y` instead of `{x = x, y = y}`. But what happens when you want to add a third dimension, or switch to a polar representation? Then you have to break everyone's code in a major version release. Instead, provide a function like `fromXY` to construct a point. Then you can add `fromPolar` or `fromXYZ` later.

If your points are type aliased records or tuples, and the type is completely hidden, other people can't write type annotations without knowing and relying on the type. Exported or not, client code can construct and inspect the values without your library, which is also bad when it comes time to extend it.

Instead, use a custom type where the type is exported but the tags are not, known as an _opaque_ type. It's not hidden since you can see that it's there, but you can't see into it, hence it's opaque. To create such a type, you include it in the list of values that the module exports. So the first line of your file might be `module MyModule exposing (myFunction, MyType)`. In this example, `MyType` (if it is a custom type) will be opaque. Then `myFunction` can take or return the opaque type.

You can (and often should) use opaque types even if there is only one tag. If you have a dozen values to track, you can tag a record. Then you can change the record even between minor releases.


## Naming

### Use human readable names

Abbreviations are generally a silly idea for an API. Having an API that is clear is more important than saving three or four characters by dropping letters from a name.

### Use camel case for module names

Module name should follow [upper camel case notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case),
for example a "GrapQL query module" should be named as "GrapQl.Query".

### Module names should not reappear in function names

A function called `State.runState` is redundant and silly. More importantly, it encourages people to use `import State exposing (..)` which does not scale well. In files with many so-called "unqualified" dependencies, it is essentially impossible to figure out where functions are coming from. This can make large code bases impossible to understand, especially if custom infix operators are used as well. Repeating the module name actively encourages this kind of unreadable code.

With a name like `State.run` the user is encouraged to disambiguate functions with namespacing, leading to a codebase that will be clearer to people reading the project for the first time.
